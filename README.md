# Panorama - a statistics plugin for Pelican

## Overview

**Panorama** is a [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) plugin to generate statistics from blog posts (number of posts per year, categories and so on) and display them as beautiful charts.

No more talking, see

## Functional overview

Produce statistics based on posts metadata and display them by using several charts.
The mapping between data and renderers is done by configuration.

Metadata data used:

	Title: My super title
	Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
	Category: Python
	Tags: pelican, publishing

## Technical overview

This plugin uses:

- The Pelican [plugins feature](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html).
- The [Python Wrapper for NVD3](https://github.com/areski/python-nvd3).
- The [Pandas Data Analysis Library)](http://pandas.pydata.org).

### Design

Some design elements:

- The plugin mechanisms using [blinker](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blinker).
- A `DataProducer` using metadata to produce statistical data. Several `DataProducer` are available one for each data type.
- A `DataRenderer` using statistical data to render charts. Several `DataRenderer` are available one for each rendering (chart). Each produces a `js` script stored in the Pelican output directory.
- A `DataConfigurator` to map `DataProducer` to `DataRenderer`. Part of the configuration is accessible through a configuration file

Generated charts are available in the Pelican `context` (holding the name `panorama_charts`) and can be used by any [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) Pelican template to be integrated in the blog.

## Installation

### Get the plugin

The most convenient way is to clone the repository, but the distribution can also be downloaded and extracted.
The root folder of the Panorama distribution will be named `PANORAMA_DIR` in the rest of this chapter.

### Install plugin dependencies

It is recommended to use virtualenv see the section "Development environment installation" for more details.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Add NVD3 dependencies to your template

Panorama generates HTML content requiring javascript and css to display.

Download the following files from [NVD3](http://nvd3.org):

- `nv.d3.min.js`
- `nv.d3.css`

Download the following file from [D3JS](http://d3js.org)

- `d3.zip`

Create a `panorama` directory in `themes/<your_theme>/static/`.
Put them in this directory `themes/<your_theme>/static/panorama/` as described below

```bash
	|- d3
	|   |-- d3.js
	|   |-- d3.min.js
	|   |-- LICENSE
	|- nvd3
	|   |-- nv.d3.min.js
	|   |-- src	
	|       |-- nv.d3.css
```

### Declare the plugin in the Pelican conf

These settings are made in the Pelican configuration file (`pelicanconf.py`). 

In order to load the plugin you will need to specify the location where plugins are stored and which plugins are used. Assuming this is the first time plugins are used with Pelican, the configuration should look like this:

```python
PLUGIN_PATH = 'plugins'
PLUGINS = ['panorama']
```
Note: `PLUGIN_PATH` has to refer to the location where the Panorama plugin is stored, i.e. `PANORAMA_DIR`. For example, use `../panorama/panorama` if the panorama distribution is extracted at the same level than your Pelican site directory. Either the absolute path or the relative path to the plugin directory can be used in the settings file.

Next it is required to configure the `DIRECT_TEMPLATES` setting. It tells Pelican which templates are to be used directly to render content. It is necessary to add the page that will display Panorama stats, let's call it `stats.html`.

```python
DIRECT_TEMPLATES = (('index', 'tags', 'categories', 'authors', 'archives', 'stats'))
```
If you already have this setting in your configuration file, you simply need to append `stats` at the end.

### Create a template

The last step is to use data generated by Panorama in a template in order to display charts. A simple example is given in the `template/test_page.html` file. 
This page has to match the name declared in the `DIRECT_TEMPLATES` setting, so it is called `stats.html` and created in the `themes/<your_theme>/template` directory. Here is an example :

```jinja
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block title %}Stats - {{ super() }}{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<link href="/theme/panorama/nvd3/src/nv.d3.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="/theme/panorama/d3/d3.min.js"></script>
<script src="/theme/panorama/nvd3/nv.d3.min.js"></script>

<section id="content" >
    <div class="body">
        <header>
          <h1>Stats</h1>
        </header>
        {% for chart_id, chart in panorama_charts.iteritems() %}
        <h2>{{ stats.name }}</h2>
        <div class="entry-content">
        {{ chart.container }}
        {{ chart.htmlcontent }}
        </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
</section>
{% endblock %}
```
## How to

### Run tests

Go to the Panorama root project directory and launch the following command:

```bash
$ python -m unittest discover
```

## Development environment installation

### Installing virtualenv

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Configure the `.bashrc` file

```bash
# pip should only run if there is a virtualenv currently activated
export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true
# cache pip-installed packages to avoid re-downloading
export PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE=$HOME/.pip/cachecontent/*
```

Source the file

```bash
$ source .bashrc
```

### Creating and activating the virtual environment

```bash
$ mkdir virtualenvs
$ cd virtualenvs
$ virtualenv v_panorama
```

Activate the environment

```bash
$ source $HOME/virtualenvs/v_panorama/bin/activate
```

### Install the requirements

Go to the Git folder and install the requirements.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Workflow

GitHub's "Issues" are used for the following:

- bug tracking
- feature requests
- planned features
- release/version management
